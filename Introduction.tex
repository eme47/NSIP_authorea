We conducted $^{15}$N DNA stable isotope probing (SIP) experiments to investigate diazotroph diversity in developing Colorado plateau biological soil crusts (BSC). Although molecular characterizations of BSC \textit{nifH} diversity have yielded predominantly heterocystous cyanobacteria-like \textit{nifH} genes, microbes that appear to incorporate $^{15}$N into DNA as determined by DNA-SIP were not cyanobacteria.

BSC cover a wide geographic range and area major node with respect to N flux in arid ecosystems.
