\section{Introduction}
Biological soil crusts (BSC) are specialized microbial mat communitites that form at the soil surface in arid environmets and fill a variety of important ecological functions in arid ecosystems. BSC occupy plant interspaces and cover a
wide, global geographic range \citep{garcia2003estimates}. The ground cover of
BSC on the Colorado Plateau has been measured as high as 80\% by remote sensing
\citep{karnieli2001}. The global biomass of BSC \textit{Cyanobacteria} alone is
estimated at 54 x 10$^{12}$ g C \citep{garcia2003estimates}. BSC play important
roles in arid ecosystem productivity and are responsible for significant
nitrogen (N) flux (for review of BSC N$_{2}$-fixation see \citet{belnap2003}).
N2-fixation represents the dominant source of new ecosystem N in more than 80\%
of BSC from diverse sites across North America, Africa, and Australia 
\citep{Evans_1999}, while atmospheric N deposition was a dominant source of N
in only a minority of sites. The presence of BSC is positively correlated with
vascular plant survival due in part to BSC ecosystem N contributions (for
review of BSC-vascular plant interactions see \citet{BelnapVascular}). Climate
change and disturbance could alter BSC microbial community structure and membership
and therefore it is possible that there wll also be changes in diazotroph diversity
and N$_{2}$-fixation and that these changes can alter the BSC N-budget.

BSC N$_{2}$-fixation rate studies (typically employing the acetylene reduction assay
(ARA)) have explored BSC diazotroph activity across various ecological
gradients. Reported BSC N$_{2}$-fixation rates vary significantly across samples
and studies \citep{Evans_2001}.  The reasons for inter-site and inter-sample
variability are complex and likely include the spatial heterogeneity of BSC
\citep{Evans_2001} and the impact of recent environmental change on
N$_{2}$-fixation rates (see \citet{Belnap_2001} for discussion).  Moreover, the ARA
assay is subject to methodological artifacts that can complicate making robust
comparisons across sample types that differ in physical and biological
characteristics (see \citet{Belnap_2001} for review). Nonetheless,
N$_{2}$-fixation rates are consistently higher in mature BSC than in young,
early successional BSC \citep{Belnap_2002, 14766579}. This difference may be
due to the proliferation of heterocystous \textit{Cyanobacteria} in older mats
and is consistent with the theory that heterocystous \textit{Cyanobacteria} 
provide the main source of fixed-N in BSC. Alternatively, the N$_{2}$-fixation rate
differences between young and old BSC might be attributable to methodological
artifacts.  For instance, \citet{15643930} show that N$_{2}$-fixation in mature
mats is maximal at the crust surface (coincident with heterocystous
cyanobacteria) while it is maximal below the crust sruface in early
successional BSC.  Diffusional limitation can potentially cause ARA to
underestimate N$_{2}$-fixation which occurs below the crust surface and as a
result ARA may systematically underestimate rates of N2-fixation in early
successional BSC.  Diffusion would not be an issue when measuring
N$_{2}$-fixation rates in mature crust as nitrogenase activity peaks near the
surface.  Differences of N2 fixation rate between developing and mature BSC
were not statistically significant when aerial rates were estimated by
integrating across ARA performed on thin (1-3mm) slices across a BSC depth
profile \citet{15643930}.

Molecular studies of BSC microbial diversity include explorations of the BSC
microbial community vertical profile \citep{Garcia_Pichel_2003}, BSC
\textit{nifH} gene content surveys (e.g. \citet{14766579}, \citet{Yeager_2012},
\citet{Yeager} and \citet{Steppe_1996}), and next-generation-sequencing (NGS)
enabled studies of BSC SSU rRNA gene content across wide geographic ranges
\citep{Garcia_Pichel_2013, Steven_2013}. Early successional  BSC are often
described as "light" in appearance relative to "dark" mature BSC
\citep{Belnap_2002, 14766579}. Mature BSC possess greater numbers of
heterocystous \textit{Cyanobacteria} (i.e \textit{Scytonema},
\textit{Spirirestis}, and \textit{Nostoc} \citep{Yeager, Yeager_2012}) than
developing BSC but both young and old BSC are dominated by non-heterocystous
\textit{Cyanobacteria} (\textit{Microcoleus vaginatus} or \textit{M.
steenstrupii}) \citep{14766579, Garcia_Pichel_2013}.  Heterocystous
\textit{Cyanobacteria} are the numerically dominant BSC diazotrophs in
\textit{nifH} clone libraries \citep{Yeager, 14766579, Yeager_2012}.
Eighty-nine \% of 693 \textit{nifH} sequences derived from Colorado Plateau and
New Mexico BSC samples as heterocystous cyanobacterial (non-cyanobacterial
\textit{nifH} sequences were largely attributed to alpha- and beta-
\textit{proteobacteria}) \citet{Yeager}. However, an early survey of Colorado
Plateau BSC \textit{nifH} diversity recovered \textit{nifH} genes related to
\textit{Gammaproteobacteria} as well as a clade that included \textit{nifH}
genes from the anaerobes \textit{Clostridium pssteurianum},
\textit{Desulfovibrio gigas} and \textit{Chromatium buderi},

The influence of microbial community membership and structure on BSC
N$_{2}$-fixation is an ongoing research question \citep{Belnap28062013}. While
the presence/abundance of heterocystous \textit{Cyanobacteria} has been
proposed as the mechanism behind increased N$_{2}$-fixation in mature BSC, it
is unclear if mature BSC actually fix more N than early successional BSC (see
\citet{15643930}). More studies are necessary to elucidate the microbial
membership influence on BSC N$_{2}$-fixation and to determine if heterocystous
\textit{Cyanobacteria} are the only keystone diazotrophs. The first step in
defining structure function relationships with respect to N$_{2}$-fixation is a
full accounting of BSC diazotrophs. Towards this end we conducted
$^{15}$N$_{2}$ DNA stable isotope probing (DNA-SIP) experiments with light,
developing Colorado Plateau BSC.  DNA-SIP with $^{15}$N$_{2}$ has not been
attempted with BSC. DNA-SIP provides an accounting of \textit{active}
diazotrophs whereas \textit{nifH} clone libraries account for microbes with the
genomic potential for N$_{2}$-fixation.  Further, we investiage the
distribution of these active diazotrophs through collections of SSU rRNA
gene sequences from BSC NGS microbial diversity surveys over a range of spatial
scales and soil types \citep{Garcia_Pichel_2013, Steven_2013}.
