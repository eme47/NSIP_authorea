\section{Introduction}

%What are soil crusts?
%Ecological importance/function

Biological soil crusts (BSC) are a cyanobacterial mat-like surface layer in arid soil. Millmeters in depth, BSC are found in plant interspaces and cover a wide, global geographic range \cite{garcia2003estimates}. The ground cover of BSC on the Colorado Plateau has been measured as high as 80\% by remote sensing \cite{karnieli2001}. The global biomass of BSC cyanobacteria alone is estimated at 54 x 10$^{12}$ g C \cite{garcia2003estimates}. BSC are play important roles in arid ecosystem productiviity and are responsible for significant N flux (for review of BSC N fixation see \citet{belnap2003}). For example, \citet{Evans_1999} found approximately five times as many soil crust samples from sites in North America, Africa and Australia had $\delta^{15}$N values indicative of high N-fixation input relative to the number of samples where N-input was likely dominated by atmospheric deposition. The presence of BSC is ultimately positively correlated with vascular plant survival due in part to BSC ecosystem N contributions (for review of BSC-vacular plant interactions see \citet{BelnapVascular}).

Molecular studies of BSC microbial diversity include explorations of vertical BSC microbial diversity with depth \cite{Garcia_Pichel_2003}, surveys BSC \textit{nifH} gene content (e.g. \citet{14766579}, \citet{Yeager_2012}, \citet{Yeager} and \citet{Steppe_1996}), and next-generation-sequenceing (NGS) enabled studies of BSC SSU rRNA gene content across wide geographic ranges CITE CITE. \citet{Garcia_Pichel_2003} found that BSC microbial diversity is organized vertically likely as the result of vertically oriented environmental gradients (e.g. light and oxygen). \textit{nifH} surveys have been conducted across BSC development stages \cite{14766579} as well as seasons, temperatures and precipitation gradients \cite{Yeager_2012}. Mature, more fully developed BSC possess greater numbers of heterocystous cyanobacteria (e.g. \textit{Nostoc, Syctonema}) than developing BSC but both young and old BSC are dominated by the non-heterocystous cyanobacterium \textit{Microcoleus vaginatus} \cite{14766579}. Young or recently disturbed BSC are often described as "light" in appearance relative to "dark" mature BSC \cite{Belnap_2002}.  Although an early study of \textit{nifH} diversity recovered genes from a Colorado Plateau BSC that appeared to be derived from the \textit{Gammaproteobacteria} as well as a clade that included \textit{nifH} genes from the anaerobes \textit{Clostridium pssteurianum}, \textit{Desulfovibrio gigas} and \textit{Chromatium buderi}, subsequent studies have found heterocystous cyanobacteria to be the numerically dominant BSC diazotrophs \cite{Yeager, 14766579, Yeager_2012}. Specifically, \citet{Yeager}--in a study of overall BSC \textit{nifH} diversity--categorized 89\% of 693 \textit{nifH} sequences derived from Colorado Plateau and New Mexico BSC samples as heterocycstous cyanobacterial (non-cyanobacterial \textit{nifH} sequences were largely attributed to alpha- and beta- \textit{proteobacteria}). The heterocystous cyanobacterial BSC diazotrophs fall into three genera, \textit{Scytonema}, \textit{Spirirestis}, and \textit{Nostoc} \cite{Yeager, Yeager_2012}.

%Why characterize diazotrophs?
%Conclusions from previous studies
BSC N fixation rate studies (typically employing the acetylene reduction assay (ARA) CITE) have explored BSC diazotroph activity across various ecological gradients. BSC N-fixation rates appear to vary significantly overall CITE (Evans Lange review). The source of this variability is complex and likely includes the spatial heterogeneity of BSC CITE, the impact on recent environmental conditions on N-fixation rates CITE (Belnap 2002 for discussion), and variability in C$_{2}$H$_{2}$ conversion ratios (Belnap 2002 for review). Moreover, the ARA assay is subject to many methodological artifacts that preclude comparisons of absolute rates (see CITE for review). Despite the confounding overall N-fixation rate measurement variability, older, dark BSC N fixation rates have been measured higher than for younger, light BSC CITE. This difference may be due to the proliferation of heterocystous cyanobacteria in older mats and is consistent with the assumption that heterocystous cyanobacteria are the primary BSC diazotrophs (see CITE). Alternatively, the N fixation rate differences between young and old BSC might be attributable to methodological artifacts. For instance, \citet{15643930} show that N fixation rates measured from intact cores of developing BSC may be artifcatually low due to delayed acetylene/ethylene diffusion through the crust in a typical acetylene reduction assay incubation timeframe. When total N fixation rates were calculated by integrating N fixation rates of 1-3 mm depth BSC core slices (thus mitigating ethene/acetylene flux limitations), N fixation rate differences between young and old BSCs were not statistically significant \cite{15643930}.

%Conclusion of this study
%method considerations 
The microbial community membership and structure influences on BSC N fixation is an ongoing research question. While the presence of heterocystous cyanobacteria has been proposed as the underlying microbial membership influence on increased N fixation in older BSC, it is unclear if the premise tha older BSC fix N at greater rates is correct (see CITE). More studies are necessary to elucidate the microbial membership influence on BSC N fixation and to confirm heterosystous cyanobaceria as keystone diazotrophs. To further probe the diversity of diazotrophs in BSC we conducted $^{15}$N DNA stable isotope probing (SIP) experiments with developing Colorado Plateau biological soil crusts (BSC). Although molecular characterizations of BSC \textit{nifH} diversity in other studies have yielded predominantly heterocystous cyanobacteria \textit{nifH} genes CITE, microbes from young, developing BSC that incorporated $^{15}$N into DNA as determined by DNA-SIP in this study were not cyanobacteria but included heterotrophic diazotrophs in the \textit{Gammaproteobacteria}, \textit{Clostridiaceae} and \textit{Deltaproteobacteria}. Moreover, we explore the distribution of putative diazotrophs uncovered in this study as well as by CITE and CITE through a collection of SSU rRNA libraries from a BSC microbial diversity surveys over a range of spatial scales and soil types CITE.
