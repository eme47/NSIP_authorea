\section{Introduction}
Biological soil crusts (BSC) are specialized microbial mat communitites
that form at the soil surface in arid environmets and fill a variety of
important ecological functions in arid ecosystems. BSC occupy plant
interspaces and cover a wide, global geographic range
\citep{garcia2003estimates}. The ground cover of BSC on the Colorado
Plateau has been measured as high as 80\% by remote sensing
\citep{karnieli2001}. The global biomass of BSC \textit{Cyanobacteria}
alone is estimated at 54 x 10$^{12}$ g C \citep{garcia2003estimates}.
BSC play important roles in arid ecosystem productivity and are
responsible for significant nitrogen (N) flux (for review of BSC
N-fixation see \citet{belnap2003}). For example, N-input via N-fixation
versus atmospheric depositon was predominant in five times as many BSC
samples from North America, Africa and Australia \citep{Evans_1999}.
The presence of BSC is positively correlated with vascular plant
survival due in part to BSC ecosystem N contributions (for review of
BSC-vascular plant interactions see \citet{BelnapVascular}). Climate
change and disturbance alter BSC microbial community structure and
membership and therefore can alter diazotroph diversity and the BSC
N-budget.

BSC N-fixation rate studies (typically employing the acetylene
reduction assay (ARA)) have explored BSC diazotroph activity across
various ecological gradients. Reported BSC N-fixation rates vary
significantly \citep{Evans_2001}.  The reasons for this variability are
complex and likely include the spatial heterogeneity of BSC
\citep{Evans_2001} and the impact of recent environmental conditions on
N-fixation rates (see \citet{Belnap_2001} for discussion).  Moreover,
the ARA assay is subject to methodological artifacts that preclude
cross-study and possibly intra-study but inter-environment type
comparisons (see \citet{Belnap_2001} for review). Nonetheless, mature
BSC N-fixation rate measurements have been higher than younger,
developing BSC N-fixation rate measurements \citep{Belnap_2002,
14766579}. This difference may be due to the proliferation of
heterocystous \textit{Cyanobacteria} in older mats and is consistent
with the theory that heterocystous \textit{Cyanobacteria} are the
primary BSC diazotrophs.  Alternatively, the N-fixation rate
differences between young and old BSC might be attributable to
methodological artifacts.  For instance, N-fixation rates peak at a
lower depth in developing BSC as compared to mature BSC
\citep{15643930}. When N-fixation is measured from intact cores of
developing BSC the measurement may be low artifactually because the
incubation timeframe is too short for acetylene/ethylene to diffuse
through the crust to and from the peak N-fixation rate depth. Diffusion
would not be an issue when measuring N-fixation rates in mature crust
as nitrogenase activity peaks near the surface. When total N-fixation
rates were calculated by integrating rates over 1-3 mm depth slices
along full BSC cores (thus mitigating ethene/acetylene flux
limitations), N-fixation rate differences between developing and mature
BSC were not statistically significant \citep{15643930}.

Molecular studies of BSC microbial diversity include explorations of
the BSC microbial community vertical profile
\citep{Garcia_Pichel_2003}, BSC \textit{nifH} gene content surveys
(e.g. \citet{14766579}, \citet{Yeager_2012}, \citet{Yeager} and
\citet{Steppe_1996}), and next-generation-sequencing (NGS) enabled
studies of BSC SSU rRNA gene content across wide geographic ranges
\citep{Garcia_Pichel_2013, Steven_2013}. 
%\citet{Garcia_Pichel_2003} found that BSC microbial diversity is
%organized vertically, likely as the result of vertically oriented
%environmental gradients (e.g. light and oxygen).
\textit{nifH} surveys have been conducted across BSC development stages
\citep{14766579}, as well as across seasons, temperatures and
precipitation gradients \citep{Yeager_2012}. Mature, more fully
developed BSC possess greater numbers of heterocystous
\textit{Cyanobacteria} (e.g. \textit{Nostoc, Syctonema}) than
developing BSC but both young and old BSC are dominated by
non-heterocystous \textit{Cyanobacteria} (\textit{Microcoleus
vaginatus} or \textit{M. steenstrupii}) \citep{14766579,
Garcia_Pichel_2013}. Young or recently disturbed BSC are often
described as "light" in appearance relative to "dark" mature BSC
\citep{Belnap_2002, 14766579}. Heterocystous \textit{Cyanobacteria} are
the numerically dominant BSC diazotrophs in \textit{nifH} clone
libraries \citep{Yeager, 14766579, Yeager_2012} although an early
survey of Colorado Plateau BSC \textit{nifH} diversity recovered
\textit{nifH} genes related to \textit{Gammaproteobacteria} as well as
a clade that included \textit{nifH} genes from the anaerobes
\textit{Clostridium pssteurianum}, \textit{Desulfovibrio gigas} and
\textit{Chromatium buderi}, Specifically, \citet{Yeager}--in a study of
overall BSC \textit{nifH} diversity--categorized 89\% of 693
\textit{nifH} sequences derived from Colorado Plateau and New Mexico
BSC samples as heterocystous cyanobacterial (non-cyanobacterial
\textit{nifH} sequences were largely attributed to alpha- and beta-
\textit{Proteobacteria}). The heterocystous cyanobacterial BSC
diazotrophs fall into three genera, \textit{Scytonema},
\textit{Spirirestis}, and \textit{Nostoc} \citep{Yeager, Yeager_2012}. 
%Studies of BSC microbial diversity over broad geographic ranges have
%elucidated how soil parent material correlates to above and below
%crust microbial community membership and structure \citep{Steven_2013}
%and that the predominant BSC cyanobacterium shifts from \textit{M.
%vaginatus} to \textit{M. steenstrupii} with increasing mean annual
%temperature \citep{Garcia_Pichel_2013}.

The influence of microbial community membership and structure on BSC
N-fixation is an ongoing research question \citep{Belnap28062013}.
While the presence/abundance of heterocystous \textit{Cyanobacteria}
has been proposed as the mechanism behind increased N-fixation in
mature BSC, it is unclear if mature BSC actually fix more N (see
\citet{15643930}). More studies are necessary to elucidate the
microbial membership influence on BSC N-fixation and to determine if
heterocystous \textit{Cyanobacteria} are the only keystone diazotrophs.
The first step in defining structure function relationships with
respect to N-fixation is a full accounting of BSC diazotrophs. Towards
this end we conducted $^{15}$N$_{2}$ DNA stable isotope probing
(DNA-SIP) experiments with light, developing Colorado Plateau BSC.
DNA-SIP with $^{15}$N$_{2}$ has not been previously attempted with BSC. DNA-SIP
provides an accounting of \textit{active} diazotrophs whereas \textit{nifH}
clone libraries account for microbes with the genomic potential for N-fixation.
Further, we track the distribution of putative diazotrophs uncovered in this
study through collections of NGS SSU rRNA gene sequence collections from BSC
microbial diversity surveys over a range of spatial scales and soil types
\citep{Garcia_Pichel_2013, Steven_2013}.
