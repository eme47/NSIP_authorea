\section{Introduction}

%What are soil crusts?
%Ecological importance/function

Biological soil crusts (BSC) are a dessicated cyanobacterial mat-like surface layer atop arid soil. Millmeters in depth, BSC are found in arid ecosystem plant interspaces and cover a wide geographic range thoughout the world CITE. BSC are responsible for significant arid ecosystem N flux (CITE). Mature BSC possess greater numbers of heterocystous cyanobacteria (e.g. \textit{Nostoc, Syctonema}) than developing BSC. Both young and old BSC are dominated by the non-heterocystous cyanobacterium \texit{Microcoleus vaginatus}. Young BSC are often described as "light" in appearance relative to "darker" mature BSC, CITE.

%Why characterize diazotrophs?
%Conclusions from previous studies
N$_{2}$ fixation in BSC has been widely studied via culture-based and culture independent molecular techniques (e.g. characterization \textit{nifH} gene diversity, CITE) and analytical methods (e.g. acetylene reduction assays to determine N$_{2}$ fixation CITE). Molecular studies have elucidated a vertically structured community CITE within the top X mm of BSC and have characterized the diversity of potential diazotrophs from nifH gene sequence libraries CITE. Although an early study of \textit{nifH} diversity recovered genes from a Colorado Plateau BSC that appeared to be derived from the \textit{Gammaproteobacteria} as well as a clade that included \textit{nifH} genes from the anaerobes \textit{Clostridium pssteurianum}, \textit{Desulfovibrio gigas} and \textit{Chromatium buderi}, subsequent studies have found heterocystous cyanobacteria to be the numerically dominant BSC diazotrophs CITE. 

Measured N$_{2}$ BSC fixation rates vary widely likely reflecting the spatial heterogeneity of BSC but older, dark BSC rates have consistently been measured higher than younger, light BSC CITE. This difference may be due to the proliferation of heterocystous cyanobacteria in older mats. Alternatively, the N fixation rate differences between young and old BSC might be attributable to methodological artifacts. For instance, \citet{15643930} show that N$_{2}$ fixation rates measured from intact cores of developing BSC may be artifcatually low due to delayed acetylene/ethylene diffusion through the crust in a typical acetylene reduction assay incubation timeframe. When total N$_{2}$ fixation rates were calculated by integrating N fixation rates of 1-3 mm depth BSC core slices (thus mitigating flux limitations), N$_{2}$ fixation rate differences between young and old BSCs were not statistically significant \cite{15643930}.

%method considerations 
To further probe the diversity of diazotrophs in BSC we conducted $^{15}$N DNA stable isotope probing (SIP) experiments with developing Colorado Plateau biological soil crusts (BSC). Although molecular characterizations of BSC \textit{nifH} diversity in other studies have yielded predominantly heterocystous cyanobacteria \textit{nifH} genes CITE, microbes from young, developing BSC that incorporated $^{15}$N into DNA as determined by DNA-SIP in this study were not cyanobacteria but included heterotrophic diazotrophs in the \textit{Gammaproteobacteria}, \textit{Clostridiaceae} and \textit(Deltaproteobacteria}.
