\section{Introduction}

%What are soil crusts?
%Ecological importance/function

Biological soil crusts (BSC) are a microbial mat-like surface layer in arid soil. Millmeters in depth, BSC are found in plant interspaces and cover a wide, global geographic range \cite{garcia2003estimates}. The ground cover of BSC on the Colorado Plateau has been measured as high as 80\% by remote sensing \cite{karnieli2001}. The global biomass of BSC cyanobacteria alone is estimated at 54 x 10$^{12}$ g C \cite{garcia2003estimates}. BSC play important roles in arid ecosystem productivity and are responsible for significant N flux (for review of BSC N-fixation see \citet{belnap2003}). For example, \citet{Evans_1999} found approximately five times as many soil crust samples from sites in North America, Africa and Australia had $\delta^{15}$N values indicative of high N-fixation input relative to the number of samples where $\delta^{15}$N values indicated N input was predominantly from atmospheric deposition. The presence of BSC is positively correlated with vascular plant survival due in part to BSC ecosystem N contributions (for review of BSC-vacular plant interactions see \citet{BelnapVascular}).

Molecular studies of BSC microbial diversity include explorations of vertical BSC microbial diversity with depth \cite{Garcia_Pichel_2003}, BSC \textit{nifH} gene content surveys (e.g. \citet{14766579}, \citet{Yeager_2012}, \citet{Yeager} and \citet{Steppe_1996}), and next-generation-sequenceing (NGS) enabled studies of BSC SSU rRNA gene content across wide geographic ranges \cite{Garcia_Pichel_2013, Steven_2013}. \citet{Garcia_Pichel_2003} found that BSC microbial diversity is organized vertically likely as the result of vertically oriented environmental gradients (e.g. light and oxygen). \textit{nifH} surveys have been conducted across BSC development stages \cite{14766579} in addition to seasons, temperatures and precipitation gradients \cite{Yeager_2012}. Mature, more fully developed BSC possess greater numbers of heterocystous cyanobacteria (e.g. \textit{Nostoc, Syctonema}) than developing BSC but both young and old BSC are dominated by non-heterocystous cyanobacteria (\textit{Microcoleus vaginatus} or \textit{M. steenstrupii}) \cite{14766579, Garcia_Pichel_2013}. Young or recently disturbed BSC are often described as "light" in appearance relative to "dark" mature BSC \cite{Belnap_2002}.  Although an early study of Colorado Plateau BSC \textit{nifH} diversity presented \textit{nifH} genes related to \textit{Gammaproteobacteria} as well as a clade that included \textit{nifH} genes from the anaerobes \textit{Clostridium pssteurianum}, \textit{Desulfovibrio gigas} and \textit{Chromatium buderi}, subsequent studies have found heterocystous cyanobacteria to be the numerically dominant BSC diazotrophs \cite{Yeager, 14766579, Yeager_2012}. Specifically, \citet{Yeager}--in a study of overall BSC \textit{nifH} diversity--categorized 89\% of 693 \textit{nifH} sequences derived from Colorado Plateau and New Mexico BSC samples as heterocycstous cyanobacterial (non-cyanobacterial \textit{nifH} sequences were largely attributed to alpha- and beta- \textit{proteobacteria}). The heterocystous cyanobacterial BSC diazotrophs fall into three genera, \textit{Scytonema}, \textit{Spirirestis}, and \textit{Nostoc} \cite{Yeager, Yeager_2012}. Studies of BSC microbial diversity over broad geographic ranges have elucidated how soil parent material correlates to above and below crust microbial community membership and structure \cite{Steven_2013} and that the most abundant BSC cyanobacterial primary producer shifts from \textit{M. vaginatus} to \textit{M. steenstrupii} with increasing mean annual temperature \cite{Garcia_Pichel_2013}.

%Why characterize diazotrophs?
%Conclusions from previous studies
BSC N-fixation rate studies (typically employing the acetylene reduction assay (ARA)) have explored BSC diazotroph activity across various ecological gradients. Reported BSC N-fixation rates vary significantly \cite{Evans_2001}. The reasons for this variability are complex and likely include the spatial heterogeneity of BSC \cite{Evans_2001} and the impact of recent environmental conditions on N-fixation rates (see \citet{Belnap_2001} for discussion). Moreover, the ARA assay is subject to methodological artifacts that preclude cross-study and possibly intra-study but inter-environment type comparisons (see \citet{Belnap_2001} for review). Despite the general BSC N-fixation rate measurement variability, older, dark BSC N-fixation rates have been measured higher than N-fixation rates for younger, light BSC \cite{Belnap_2002, 14766579}. This difference may be due to the proliferation of heterocystous cyanobacteria in older mats and is consistent with the theory that heterocystous cyanobacteria are the primary BSC diazotrophs. Alternatively, the N-fixation rate differences between young and old BSC might be attributable to methodological artifacts. For instance, \citet{15643930} show that N-fixation rates measured from intact cores of developing BSC may be artifcatually low due to delayed acetylene/ethylene diffusion through the crust in a typical ARA incubation timeframe. When total N-fixation rates were calculated by integrating N-fixation rates of 1-3 mm depth BSC core slices (thus mitigating ethene/acetylene flux limitations), N-fixation rate differences between young and old BSCs were not statistically significant \cite{15643930}.

%Conclusion of this study
%method considerations 
The microbial community membership and structure influences on BSC N-fixation is an ongoing research question \cite{Belnap28062013}. While the presence/abundance of heterocystous cyanobacteria has been proposed as the underlying microbial membership influence on increased N-fixation in older BSC, it is unclear if the premise that older BSC fix more N is always correct (see \citet{15643930}). More studies are necessary to elucidate the microbial membership influence on BSC N-fixation and to determine if  heterosystous cyanobaceria are the only keystone diazotrophs. To further probe the diversity of diazotrophs in BSC we conducted $^{15}$N DNA stable isotope probing (DNA-SIP) experiments with developing Colorado Plateau BSC. Although molecular characterizations of BSC \textit{nifH} diversity in other studies have yielded predominantly heterocystous cyanobacterial \textit{nifH} genes, microbes from young, developing BSC that incorporated $^{15}$N into DNA as determined by DNA-SIP in this study were not cyanobacteria but included heterotrophs in the \textit{Gammaproteobacteria}, \textit{Clostridiaceae} and \textit{Deltaproteobacteria}. Further, we explore the distribution of putative diazotrophs uncovered in this study as well as by \citet{14766579}, \citet{Yeager} and \citet{Yeager_2012} through collections of SSU rRNA libraries from a BSC microbial diversity surveys over a range of spatial scales and soil types \cite{Garcia_Pichel_2013, Steven_2013}.
