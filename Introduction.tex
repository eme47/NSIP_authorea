We conducted $^{15}$N DNA stable isotope probing (SIP) experiments to investigate diazotroph diversity in developing Colorado plateau biological soil crusts (BSC). Although molecular characterizations of BSC \textit{nifH} diversity have yielded predominantly heterocystous cyanobacteria-like \textit{nifH} genes, microbes that incorporated $^{15}$N into DNA as determined by DNA-SIP were not cyanobacteria.

BSC cover a wide geographic range and are responsible for significant N flux in arid ecosystems. Early BSC development is characterized by a period of non-heterocystous cyanobacteria predominance. Older BSC, while maintaining a significant collection of non-heterocystous cyanobacteria, include heterocystsous types (e.g. \textit{Nostoc, Syctonema}). Measured N$_{2}$ fixation rates are generally higher in older BSC than younger. However, \citet{15643930} show that N$_{2}$ fixation rates measured from intact cores of developing BSC may be artifcatually low due to delayed acetylene/ethylene diffusion. When total N fixation rates were integrated over N fixation rates of BSC core subsections along the depth of the cores, N fixation rate differences between young and old BSCs were not statistically significant \cite{15643930}.
