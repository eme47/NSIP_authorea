category counts

Of the 4340 OTU centroids established for this study (includes OTUs from \citet{Steven_2013} and \cite{Garcia_Pichel_2013}) 445 and 870 have matches in the Living Tree Project (LTP) a collection of 16S gene sequences for all sequenced type strains \cite{Yarza_2008} (LTP version 115).

Similar total OTUs were found in each data set explored in this study (i.e. the DNA-SIP data presented here, the data presented by \citet{Steven_2013} and by \citet{Garcia_Pichel_2013}). Specifically, there were 3079 OTUs (209354 total sequences after quality control) in the DNA-SIP data, 3203 OTUs (129033 total sequences after quality control) in the \citet{Garcia_Pichel_2013} study, and 2481 OTUs (129358 total sequences after quality control) in the \citet{Steven_2013} study.

There is a stark contrast in the total percentage of sequences annotated as \textit{Firmicutes} between the raw environmental samples and the DNA-SIP data. \textit{Firmicutes} represent only 0.21\% and 0.23\% of total phylum level sequence annotations in the \citet{Steven_2013} and \citet{Garcia_Pichel_2013} study, respectively. In the DNA-SIP sequcuence collection, \textit{Firmicutes} make up 19\% of phylum level sequence annotations.
