Ordination of Bray-Curtis sample pairwise distances for each incubation time. Point area is proportional to the density of the CsCl gradient fraction for each sequence library, and color reflects control (red) or labeled (blue) treatment. Inset shows Bray-Curtis distances for paired control versus labeled CsCl gradient fractions (i.e. fractions from the same incubation day and same density) against the density of the pair (p-value: XXXX, r$^{2}$: XXXX).
