Ordination of Bray-Curtis sample pairwise distances for each incubation time. Point area is proportional to the density of the CsCl gradient fraction for each sequence library. Inset shows Bray-Curtis distances for paired control versus labelled CsCl gradient fractions (i.e. fractions from the same incubation day and same density) against the Density of the pair (p-value: XXXX, r$^{2}$: XXXX).
