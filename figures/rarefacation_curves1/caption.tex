Rarefaction curves for all samples presented by \citet{Garcia_Pichel_2013} and \citet{Steven_2013}. Inset is boxplot of estimated sampling effort for all samples in \citet{Garcia_Pichel_2013} and \citet{Steven_2013} (number of observed OTUs divided by number of CatchAll \cite{BUNGE_2010} estimated total OTUs).
