Relative abundance values in heavy fractions (density greater or equal to 1.725 g/mL) for the top 10 $^{15}$N "responders" (putative diazotrophs, see results for selection criteria of top 10) at each incubation day. See Table X for BLAST results of top 10 responders against the LTP database (release 115). Point area is proportional to CsCl gradient fraction density, and color signifies control (red) or labeled (blue) treatment.
