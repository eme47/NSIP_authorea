See methods for selection criteria for sequences in backbone tree. Edge width is proportional to number of short putative \textit{Clostridiaceae} diazotroph sequences placed at that position. Placement of short sequences can be spread across multiple edges (CITE PPLACER). Reference sequences from cultivars have boxes at tips and full species names. Tips with only accession annotations are from environmental reference sequences.
