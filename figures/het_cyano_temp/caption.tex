Relative abundance of heterocystous cyanobacteria OTUs in \citet{Garcia_Pichel_2013} samples with centroids defined by sequences in \citet{Yeager}. Grey panel background indicates OTU had sequences in at least 40\% of samples and the adjusted p-value for the change in relative abundance against mean annual temperature is statistically significant (false discovery rate < 0.10, see Methods SECTION).
