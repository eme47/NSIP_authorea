Moderated log$_{2}$ of proportion mean ratios for labeled versus control gradients (heavy fractions only, densities >1.725 g/mL). All OTUs found in at least 62.5\% of heavy fractions at a specific incubation day are shown. "X" denotes a proportion mean ratio that has a corresponding adjusted p-value below a false discovery rate of 10\% (the null model is that the proportion mean is ratio is below 0.25). The horizontal line is the proportion mean threshold for the null model, 0.25. The inset figure summarizes the taxonomy of OTUs that with proportion mean ratio p-vaules under 0.10 for at least one time point.
