Moderated log$_{2}$ of proportion mean ratios for labelled versus control gradients (heavy fractions only, densities >1.725 g/mL). All OTUs found in at least 62.5\% of heavy fractions at a specific incubation day are shown. "X" denotes a proportion mean ratio that has a corresponding adjusted p-value below a false discovery rate of 10\% (the null model is that the proportion mean is ratio is below 0.25). The horizontal line is the proportion mean threshold for the null model, 0.25.
