\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \caption{Phylogenetic trees of OTUs passing sparsity threshold for \textbf{A}
  \textit{Proteobacteria}, \textbf{B} \textit{Acidobacteria} and \textbf{C}
  \textit{Firmicutes}. $^{15}$N-responders are identified by dots present in
  column \textbf{i}. Log$_{2}$ of proportion mean ratios (labeled:control
  samples) for each OTU are presented as a heatmap in column \textbf{ii} with
  results from days 2 and 4 on the left and right sides of the column
  respectively. High values indicate $^{15}$N incorporation. Presence/absence
  of OTUs (black indicates presence) in lichen, light, or dark environmental
  samples \citep{Garcia_Pichel_2013} is shown in column \textbf{iii}.
  Presence/absence of OTUs (black indicates presence) in crust and below crust
  samples \citep{Steven_2013} is shown in column \textbf{iv}}

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \caption{Moderated log$_{2}$ of proportion mean ratios for labeled versus
  control gradients (heavy fractions only, densities $>$1.725 g/mL). All OTUs
  passing the sparsity treshold (see methods) at a specific incubation day are
  shown. Red color denotes a proportion mean ratio that has a corresponding
  adjusted p-value below a false discovery rate of 10\% (the null model is that
  the proportion mean is ratio is below 0.25). The horizontal line is the
  proportion mean threshold for the null model, 0.25. The inset figure
  summarizes the taxonomy of OTUs that with proportion mean ratio p-vaules
  under 0.10 for at least one time point.}

\begin{figure}[H]

    \caption{Relative abundance values in heavy fractions (density greater or
    equal to 1.725 g/mL) for the top 10 $^{15}$N "responders" (putative
    diazotrophs, see results for selection criteria of top 10) at each
    incubation day. See Table~\ref{tab:LTP_blast} for BLAST results against 
    the LTP database (release 115). Point area is proportional to CsCl gradient
    fraction density, and color signifies control (red) or labeled (blue)
    treatment.}

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \caption{See methods for selection criteria for sequences in backbone tree. Edge width is proportional to number of short putative \textit{Clostridiaceae} diazotroph sequences placed at that position. Placement of short sequences can be spread across multiple edges \cite{Matsen_2010}. Reference sequences from cultivars have boxes at tips and full species names. Tips with only accession annotations are from environmental reference sequences.}
