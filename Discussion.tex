\section{Discussion}

\subsection{BSC Non-Cyanobacterial Diazotrophs}
BSC N-fixation has long been attributed to heterocystous cyanobacteria and molecular microbial ecology surveys of BSC \textit{nifH} gene content have been consistent with this hypothesis findind cyanobacterial \textit{nifH} types to be numerically dominant in \textit{nifH} gene libraries \cite{Yeager, 14766579, Yeager_2012}.
