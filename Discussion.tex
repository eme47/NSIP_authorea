\section{Discussion}
BSC N-fixation has long been attributed to heterocystous
\textit{Cyanobacteria} and molecular surveys of BSC \textit{nifH} gene content
have been consistent with this hypothesis finding cyanobacterial \textit{nifH}
types to be numerically dominant in \textit{nifH} gene libraries from BSC
\citep{Yeager,14766579,Yeager_2012}. However, $^{15}$N$_{2}$ DNA-SIP revealed
non-cyanobacterial microorganisms fixed N$_{2}$ in early successional BSC samples.
DNA from early successional BSC samples--incubated for 2 and 4
days in the presence or absence of $^{15}$N$_{2}$--was collected
and separated by bouyant density in CsCl density gradients.
Heavy CsCl gradient fractions from gradients with $^{15}$N-labelled DNA were
different in phylogenetic membership/structure than heavy fractions with
unlabeled DNA (Figure~\ref{fig:ord_heavy} and Figure~\ref{fig:ordination})).
Further, heavy gradient fractions clustered by DNA type (labeled or unlabeled)
(Figure~\ref{fig:ord_heavy}). Therefore, headspace $^{15}$N$_{2}$ in
early successional BSC microcosms was incorporated into DNA. Further, OTUs
enriched in labeled gradient heavy fractions relative to control are the
specific taxa that incorporated $^{15}$N (from $^{15}$N$_{2}$) into biomass.
\textit{Proteobacteria} and \textit{Clostridiaceae} represented most OTUs
enriched in DNA from labeled gradient heavy fractions relative to control as
revealed by a robust statistical framework for quantifying and evaluating
differential OTU abundance in microbiome studies \citep{24699258, Love_2014}.
Additionally, \textit{Proteobacteria} and \textit{Clostridiaceae} represented
OTUs that most strongly responded to $^{15}$N.

It is possible that PCR-driven molecular surveys of \textit{nifH}
gene content have been biased. We propose three mechanisms that could bias
\textit{nifH} clone libraries against heteroptophic diazotrophs. First,
polyploidy in \textit{Cyanobacteria} \citep{Griese_2011} would inflate 
the representation of cyanobacteria in community DNA (beyond a cell ratio). 
Second, \textit{nifH} PCR primers could be biased against
heterotrophic diazotrophs. In general the nifH PCR primers used by
\citet{Yeager,14766579,Yeager_2012} (``19F'' and ``nifH3'') for the first round
of nested PCR have broad specificity and display at least 86\% \textit{in
silico} coverage for \textit{Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria} and ``Cluster III''
(which includes clostridial \textit{nifH}) reference \textit{nifH} sequences
\citep{Gaby_2012}. In the second round of the nested PCR protocol
used by \citet{Yeager,14766579,Yeager_2012}, primer ``nifH11'' is` biased against
``Cluster III'' (50\% \textit{in silico} coverage of reference \textit{nifH}
sequences) relative to \textit{Proteobacteria} (79\% coverage) and
\textit{Cyanobacteria} (67\% coverage), and, primer ``nifH22'' matches
\textit{Proteobacteria}, \textit{Cyanobacteria} and ``Cluster III'' reference
sequences poorly (16\%, 23\% and 21\% \textit{in silico} coverage,
respectively) \citep{Gaby_2012}.  Unfortunately, it is difficult to assess or
quantify this bias (in either direction) without knowing the \textit{nifH} gene
content \textit{de novo}. Third, heterocysts (the specialized N-fixing cells
along the trichome of filamentous heterocystous \textit{Cyanobacteria} such as
\textit{Nostoc} and \textit{Scytonema}) may be overrepresented (above a cell
ratio) in \textit{nifH} clone libraries. Heterocysts make up a fraction of
cells along a trichome and even the non-heterocyst (non-N-fixing) cells in the
trichome will possess the \textit{nifH} gene. As a result of polyploidy and the
frequency of heterocysts in a cyanobacterial filament, the ratio of
cyanobacterial to heterotroph \textit{nifH} gene copies may be 
10$^{2}$-10$^{3}$ higher than the ratio of heterocysts to heterotrophic
diazotroph cells. Regardless, our results suggest that BSC N-fixation may
include a significant non-cyanobacterial component that requires further
assessment across a more comprehensive sampling of BSC types.

We did not observe evidence for N-fixation by heterocystous
\textit{Cyanobacteria} in the early successional BSC samples used in this
study. One possible explanation for our results is that the early successional
BSC samples used in this study possessed too few heterocystous
\textit{Cyanobacteria} to statistically evaluate their $^{15}$N-incorporation.
Indeed, only 0.29\% of sequences from this study's DNA-SIP 16S rRNA gene
sequence collections were from heterocystous \textit{Cyanobacteria} (see results)
as opposed to 15\% and 23\% of total sequences in the \citet{Steven_2013} and
\citet{Garcia_Pichel_2013} data, respectively.  Nonetheless, we would still
expect even low abundance diazotrophs to show evidence for
$^{15}$N-incorporation, provided sequence counts were not too sparse in heavy
fractions. The OTUs defined by selected heterocystous \textit{Cyanobacteria}
sequences presented in \citet{Yeager}, however, all fall below the sparsity
threshold used in our analysis (see methods). Given the sparsity of
heterocystous \textit{Cyanobacteria} sequences in the DNA-SIP data set, it is
not possible to assess whether heterocystous \textit{Cyanobacteria}
incorporated $^{15}$N during the incubation. It should be noted that 
early successional BSC samples possess much less heterocystous
\textit{Cyanobacteria} in general (Figure~\ref{fig:het_steven}) so the samples
used in this study are not necessarily unrepresentative of typical early
successional BSC simply because they are lacking heterocystous
\textit{Cyanobacteria}. 

The OTUs that did appear to incorporate $^{15}$N during the incubation were
predominantly \textit{Proteobacteria} and \textit{Firmicutes}. The
\textit{Proteobacteria} OTUs for which $^{15}$N-incorporation signal was
strongest all shared high sequence identity ($>=$98.48\%) with 16S sequences
from cultivars in genera with known diazotrophs (Table~\ref{tab:LTP_blast}).
The \textit{Firmicutes} that displayed signal for $^{15}$N-incorporation
(predominantly \textit{Clostridiaceae}) were not closely related to any
cultivars (Table~\ref{tab:LTP_blast}, Figure~\ref{fig:clost_tree}). These BSC
\textit{Clostrodiaceae} diazotrophs represent a gap in culture collections.
Assessing the physiological response of these diazotrophic
\textit{Clostridiaceae} to temperature would be useful for predicting how
climate change will affect the BSC nitrogen budget.

Although too undersampled in the environmental data sets to reach statistical
conclusions, $^{15}$N-responsive OTUs were found more often in sub-crust or or
early successional BSC samples as opposed to crust or mature samples
(Figure~\ref{fig:trees} and Figure~\ref{fig:rspndr_dist}).  This result
generates some hypotheses that are counter to prior discussions regarding BSC
diazotroph temporal dynamics.  Specifically, the succession of BSC may not mark
the \textit{emergence} of diazotrophs in BSC but rather the \textit{transition}
of the diazotroph community from heterotroph to heterocystous
\textit{Cyanobacteria} dominance.  Additionally, sub-biocrust soil may
contribute significantly to the arid ecosystem N budget.

We propose that fast-growing heterotrophic diazotrophs such as
\textit{Clostridiaceae} are likely BSC ecosystem pioneers. \textit{M.
vaginatus} accumulates compatible solutes such as trehalose and sucrose as
osmoprotectants during dessication \citep{Rajeev_2013}. Additionally, although
not demonstrated specifically with \textit{M. vaginatus}, microorganisms can
rapidly excrete compatible solutes upon wetting \citep{Poolman_1998}. Many
\textit{Clostridiaceae} have a saccharolytic metabolism \citep{Wiegel_2006} and
\textit{Clostridiaceae} isolates have been shown to utilize trehalose and/or
sucrose (summarized in \citet{Wiegel_2006}). Further, \textit{Clostridiaceae}
isolates are fast-growing (doubling times typically between 30 min and 3 hr
when grown on monosaccharides in culture \citep{Wiegel_2006}). Upon wetting,
the early successional BSC environment may become rapidly rich in compatible
solutes excreted by \textit{M. vaginatus}. This boom-bust cycle would favor
fast-growing microorganisms such as \textit{Clostridiaceae} that can double
rapidly and also fix N.

Rarefaction curves of all samples from \citet{Steven_2013} and
\citet{Garcia_Pichel_2013} are still sharply increasing especially for
sub-crust samples (Figure~\ref{fig:rarefaction}). Parametric richness estimates
of BSC diversity indicate the \citet{Steven_2013} and
\citet{Garcia_Pichel_2013} sequencing efforts recovered on average 40.5\% (sd.
9.99\%) and 45.5\% (sd.  11.6\%) of predicted 16S OTUs from samples (inset
Figure~\ref{fig:rarefaction}), respectively. Therefore,
is not alarming that few of the $^{15}$N-responsive OTUS were found by
\citet{Garcia_Pichel_2013} and \citet{Steven_2013}. Even next-generation
sequencing efforts of BSC 16S rRNA genes have only shallowly sampled the full
diversity of BSC microbes.  

\subsection{Conclusion}
Heterocystous \textit{Cyanobacteria} are key contributors to the BSC N-budget,
but, the $^{15}$N-responsive OTUs found in this study and the \textit{nifH}
gene sequences from \citet{Steppe_1996} in addition to the N-fixation rate data
presented by \citet{15643930} suggest there may be significant
non-cyanobacterial BSC diazotrophs specifically within the
\textit{Clostrideaceae} and \textit{Proteobacteria}. It seems clear that
heterocystous \textit{Cyanobacteria} increase in abundance with BSC age
\citep{14766579}. It is less clear if this transition marks the emergence of
diazotrophs versus a re-structuring of the BSC diazotroph community from one
dominated by \textit{Clostridiaceae} and \textit{Proteobacteria} to one
predominantly heterocystous \textit{Cyanobacteria}. DNA-SIP is a valuable tool
in the molecular microbial ecologist's toolbox for identifying members of
microbial community functional guilds \citep{17446886}. PCR-based surveys of
diagnostic marker genes and DNA-SIP are both used to connect microbial
phylogenetic types to microbial activities, but they occupy a non-overlapping
set of strengths and weaknesses. DNA-SIP does not focus on a specific diagnostic
marker but does identify \textit{active} players in the studied process (i.e. 
N-fixation). Combined these tools can powerfully reveal connections between
ecosystem membership/structure and function. Here we supplement previous
surveys of BSC \textit{nifH} diversity, a diagnostic marker PCR-driven
approach, with $^{15}$N$_{2}$ DNA-SIP, While we do not confirm previous
results, we expand knowledge of BSC diazotroph diversity.  Predicting BSC
N-fixation with respect to climate change, althered precipitation regimes and
physical disturbance requires a careful accounting of diazotrophs including
non-cyanobacterial types.
